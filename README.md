<h3>This sample app will help you to boost up your starting to create an iOS <strong>Currency Converter</strong> app from scratch with <strong>MVVM</strong> architecture and <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a></strong>. All necessary Unit tests are included in the project to make your starting easy. This project also uses Core Data to locally store updated currency rates and calls the api only once every 30 minutes to save the bandwidth of internet data. Hope you will enjoy it.</h3>

<h1>🛠️ To run the app</h1>

<h3>To successfully run the project, just follow two steps below:</h3>

1. **Since this project uses free exchange rate api from [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/), so first you have to create a free account there.**
2. **Then use your api key/ID to this field `static let appId = "Your API key"` in `ApiConstants` file.**
3. **Now run and see the exchange rates 💥 boom 💥**
