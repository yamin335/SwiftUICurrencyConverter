# SwiftUICurrencyConverter
## MVVM (Model View View Model) based architecture

This app is created to show a clean ***MVVM (Model View View Model)*** architecture based **SwiftUI** project that will help many developers to boost up their starting for a new project. This project will also help those who are willing to make a **Currency-Converter** app using SwiftUI. Unit tests are included in the project so that one can learn unit test well. This project also uses Core Data to locally store updated currency rates and calls the api after every 30 minutes to save the bandwidth of internet data. There are also some new SwiftUI features like ***LazyGridView*** and ***Menu***. Hope you will enjoy the architecture.

***Please don't forget to star the project if you found it useful. Thank you!***

>To successfully run the project just follow a simple instruction below:

1. **Since this project uses free exchange rate api from [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/), so first you have to create a free account there.**
2. **Then use your api key/ID to this field `static let appId = "Your API key"` in `ApiConstants` file.**
3. **Finally run and see the exchange rates.**
